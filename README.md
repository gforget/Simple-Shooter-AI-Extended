# Simple Shooter - AIExtended - Develop[ment branch
This project is an extension of the final exercise, 'Simple Shooter,' from the GameDev.TV course 'UE5 C++ Developer: Code Your Own Unreal Games.' It primarily focuses on adding new gameplay mechanics, an original map, and improved AI to the project, similar to what you would expect in a AAA shooter game. The AI acts as a bot that could replace players in a multiplayer match and has the same power and goals as them: to eliminate all other players on the map and be the last survivor. As of now, the project only support a 1v1 between the player and a bot.

# Differences with the original result of the exercice
## Gameplay mechanic
- None

## AI improvement
- Engagement positioning

## New map
- None

## What was retained from the exercice
- The core third-person controller was retained (75% of the animation blueprint and the code for the ShooterCharacter class for the main character remain the same).
- The character mesh and textures were all kept as is.
- The sound effects of the gun.
- The character animations were cleaned up to reduce the overall project size.
